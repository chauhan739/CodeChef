This repository will contain
some questions' solutions which are
in CodeChef and many other platform
in their respective directories.

Whole question and its link to that
question is present in their respective
README file.

I would suggest to change the library
file from iostream to
bits/stdc++.h
Any suggestions will be most welcome
