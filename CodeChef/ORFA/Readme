“Orange Factory” is an orange supply company which supplies oranges to retailers. They have M classes of oranges. Each class can have N number of oranges (N can be the same or can vary class to class. They accept order via mail for X oranges. In response, they confirm if they can supply the oranges with a “Thank you” note and the number of oranges or with a “Sorry” note and the numbers of oranges they can supply. They also mention the defective oranges by the class they will supply. The ordered oranges are adjusted against the different classes with the most number of oranges adjusted first then the balance is adjusted against the second-highest and so on. The company is a bit superstitious as well. If the number of oranges ordered is greater than or equal to the total number of oranges in stock then they retain one orange and responds back with the “Sorry” note with total number of oranges in stock minus one and defective oranges by class.

Note: If the classes have the same number of oranges then class entered first should be selected to adjust.
